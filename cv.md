## Personal Profile
---
I am a motivated, reliable individual who graduated with a first-class honours degree in computer science from Edinburgh Napier University in July, 2016. I have a strong technical ability and I am a confident presenter. During university, I successfully combined my studies with a job as a classroom assistant, requiring both technical knowledge and great communication skills. During summer breaks, I was always involved in projects and internships and also took time to improve upon and learn new relevant technologies.

## Notable Projects

### International Group Project (China, 2015)
I was interviewed and selected to be part of an international exchange group consisting of 6 Napier students and 8 students from [Zhengzhou University of Light Industry](http://en.zzuli.edu.cn/), China. 

The group built an online classroom booking system called StudyWithMe with which students could compose or join 'study groups' and book classrooms in their university. My role was developing on both client and server, implementing functions such as notifications and a background management system for data analysis.

The application idea came from the students at Zhengzhou who have trouble finding rooms to study in with the massive amount of students at the university.

Frameworks & libraries used include Bootstrap, jQuery, Google Charts and PHP SLIM.
