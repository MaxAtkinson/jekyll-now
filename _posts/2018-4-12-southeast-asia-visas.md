I'm planning a trip to travel South East Asia, spending a few months in the following countries: **_[Thailand](#Thailand), [Laos](#Laos), [Vietnam](#Vietnam), [Cambodia](#Cambodia), [Malaysia](#Malaysia)_** (click the country to jump to it).

I've read various things from several sources and done some of my own research regarding visas for these countries, so I thought I'd put together a blog post in the form of a cheatsheet for visas in these countries.

## The Route

I've tried not to plan this out too much, but I found a great post [here](http://myfunkytravel.com/backpacking-route-south-east-asia.html) which seems to outline the most popular backpacking route, which, as it's my first time travelling Asia, is ideal:

![South East Asia Route]({{ "/assets/img/se-asia-route.png" | absolute_url }})

The route begins in Bangkok, heads to northern Thailand then crosses the border east into Laos/Vietnam, then south into Cambodia, west **_back into_** Thailand and finally south until it hits Malaysia.

Initially, I assumed I wouldn't need a Thai visa as I could use the "visa exemption". As I'm re-entering by land, however, I realised that I'd in fact need to get a [Multiple Entry Tourist Visa](https://www.tielandtothailand.com/thailand-multiple-entry-tourist-visa-requirements/) for the (not so humble) price of Â£125.

These can be obtained in person from your nearest Thai consulate (recommended) or by the slightly more laborious postal method, which involves sending your passport and application along with a postal order (oldschool cheque) or cash to London. Further details can be found [on the Thai embassy website](http://www.thaiembassy.org/london/en/services).

Nice and easy - a visa granting xx days can be obtained at land border crossings for $xx (x,xxx baht).

## <a style="color:black;" name="Vietnam">Vietnam</a>

E-mail or eVisa

## <a style="color:black;" name="Cambodia">Cambodia</a>

eVisa

## <a style="color:black;" name="Malaysia">Malaysia</a>

3 months granted on arrival.
